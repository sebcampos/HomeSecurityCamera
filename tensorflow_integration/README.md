# Tensorflow + OpenCV
First and formost a big thanks to this repository:

https://github.com/EdjeElectronics/TensorFlow-Lite-Object-Detection-on-Android-and-Raspberry-Pi/

This is where all the code and logic for implementing a tflite object detection module with opencv comes from.

Using the following command you can download a python file to test your camera, and the object detection dependencies

```
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sebcampos/HomeSecurityCamera/tensorflow_integration/
```
