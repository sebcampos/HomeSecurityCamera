# Tensorflow + OpenCV
First and formost a big thanks to this repository:

https://github.com/EdjeElectronics/TensorFlow-Lite-Object-Detection-on-Android-and-Raspberry-Pi/

This is where all the code and logic for implementing a tflite object detection module with opencv comes from.

Using the following command you can download a python file from this repo to test your camera
You can run it by calling the command `python <name_of_file>` to close the camera press the `q` key

```
